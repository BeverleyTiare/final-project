        <strong>Brain Health is a critical piece of your overall health. It underlies your ability to move, communicate, make decisions, problem solve and live a productive meaningful life. Because the brain controls so much of our daily function, it is arguably the most singular important part of human function and behaviour</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change in response to experiences: this experience-driven change occurs in both neural structure and function. 
        <br /> 
        <br /> 
        In early development our brain is agile, and the adaption of our nervous system is specific to our individual bodies, culture and surroundings. 
        <br />
        <br />  
        While a lack of use of brain functions can lead to degeneration, the life-long plasticity of the brain is supported in everyday learning.  If we train a specific brain function enhancement occurs in that specific function.
        However, training requires a suitable intensity and level of repetition across time.
        <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Developing brains prune and strengthen synapses in response to our environment, and mature brains also have a degree of plasticity.  
        But change in mature brains requires attention, positive challenge and connection to be optimal.
        <br /> 
        <br />  
        Our thoughts and actions also play a role in brain plasticity: repeated thoughts or behaviours strengthen synapses, forming habits - which then become ‘automated’ and stored in the subcortical brain. 
        So, habits become 'wired in' while lesser-used connections are pruned away. 
          <br />
          <br />
        Automated behaviours permanently stored in the subcortical region may however, not contribute to our potential across the life span. 
         As all habits are triggered by cues i.e. a place, person, event or even emotional state. If the cue can be identified, a new more useful behaviour can then be learned in response.

        <strong> Our brain is the powerhouse of regulating function, interpretating sensory information, emotion processing, and the foundation of intelligence, memory and creativity.</strong>  
        <i>And the brain is constantly active, even when we sleep. </i>
        <br /> 
        <br />
        Although genetics establishes the foundations of our cognitive health and building our cognitive reserve, we can improve brain health & cognitive health (a domain of brain health) 
        through regular exercise, a mostly plant-based diet, quality sleep, stress management, nurturing social interactions, and healthy mental stimulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        When our brains our healthy the improvements can be seen in our perception, attention, complex movement & coordination, memory & learning, emotion regulation, practical & social judgement, language, and visuo-spatial processing.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can improve our brain health through specific activities that engage the brain in novel ways that improve our cognitive function, memory & creativity, for example, meditation, visualisation (forming mental images to represent information), playing board games, jigsaw puzzles, sudoku, video games, listening to music, creating art, engaging in sports or dance and learning new skills such as a new language or a musical instrument.
        <br />
        <br />
        The key to maintaining improvements is to find something that you enjoy and sustain the practice over time. it is better to do something for a few minutes every one to two days then spend a longer period of time once per week.
